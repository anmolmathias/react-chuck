### About
Chuck Norris facts are satirical factoids about martial artist and actor Chuck Norris that have become an Internet phenomenon and as a result have become widespread in popular culture. The 'facts' are normally absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris' toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and masculinity.
This app calls the chucknorris.io API on a refresh and returns a JSON response which is parsed and presented as a 'fact'. Another random fact is generated on interacting with the `next` button and so on.
